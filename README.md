- Product category share is relatively balanced; **Widgets (27%)** and **Gadgets (26.3%)** are top categories.
- Acquisition channels with highest performance: **Facebook**, **Google**, and **Organic search**, especially in early 2025.

#### B. Product Performance Analysis
- **Widgets** dominate sales (33.73%).
- Sales are driven by a small number of top products like *Aerodynamic Copper Knife* and *Heavy-Duty Silk Chair*.

#### C. Customer Satisfaction Analytics
- Average rating: **3.47** (most clustered around rating 4).
